# Project: Guess the Number iOS App

# This project is an iOS app in which the user has 10 chances to guess the random number that the app has generated. The background color of the app changes according to how close the user was to the correct number (Red = Guess is too far off; Yellow = Guess is close; Green = Guess is correct and user wins). Hints are also provided to help the user guess the correct number. The project can be opened and tested using Xcode on a Mac.

# This project was written using Swift.
